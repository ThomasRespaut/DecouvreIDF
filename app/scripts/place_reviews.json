Absolutely stunning.\nThe price for a ticket for an adult is €16.\nYou have to.climg the staircase to go all the way up so it is quite a lot of steps to climb but well worth it. If you get tired, you have enough space to stop, catch your breath and let other people pass by.\nOnce you reach the top, you have access to a mini museum with the history of the arc de triomphe, a souvenir store and toilets.\nTo see the view, climb one more floor up and enjoy the beauty of the city. You can spend as much time there as you want, take lots of photos and enjoy the view. Really well worth it.\nTo come down, you go down another staircase.\nA few years ago, you would go up via a lift and use the staircase to go down.\nI think the elevator is only available now for handicapped or elderly people.",

The steps to the top could be challenging for some, but worth the effort for the views from the terrace. We booked tickets online beforehand so there was no wait. Strongly recommend this unless you like queues.",

Steps are well kept with a very nice railing to make the climb easier, even for those with height issues. Beautiful views of all of Paris!

Absolutely stunning.\nThe price for a ticket for an adult is €16.\nYou have to.climg the staircase to go all the way up so it is quite a lot of steps to climb but well worth it. If you get tired, you have enough space to stop, catch your breath and let other people pass by.\nOnce you reach the top, you have access to a mini museum with the history of the arc de triomphe, a souvenir store and toilets.\nTo see the view, climb one more floor up and enjoy the beauty of the city. You can spend as much time there as you want, take lots of photos and enjoy the view. Really well worth it.\nTo come down, you go down another staircase.\nA few years ago, you would go up via a lift and use the staircase to go down.\nI think the elevator is only available now for handicapped or elderly people.",

The museum inside is pretty informative too, and makes sure that there isn’t too much boring information that just drags you along. The view of the city would have been better had there been blue skies, but no one can control that so it doesn’t impact it too much",
